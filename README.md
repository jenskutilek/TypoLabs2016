# TypoLabs 2016

Code examples from my TypoLabs Berlin 2016 workshop about font pens.

Check the PDF for notes on the scripts.

## Update 2022

I made the scripts compatible with Python 3 and RoboFont, but didnâ€™t check the
correctness of results extensively, so viewer discretion is advised.

Some links from the presentation PDF are outdated, and are redirected below:
